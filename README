This project has a static analysis tool for C code. src.java in the folder has the main code for this task.
srcPartC.java in pi/partC has a modified version of the main static analysis tool that can take an extra parameter depth which specifies how many recursions of a function the code checks. reachabilityChecker.java in pi/partD finds any unreachable functions in the code.
How to run tests?
The file to be run has to be taken out of the pi folder and into the main folder before its run or paths have to be modified directly. To run the main src.java file tests execute "verify.sh".
clean.sh runs "make clean" in all tests directories, which removes temporary files created by verify.sh.
To generate the output for one test, run "make" in the test's directory.
